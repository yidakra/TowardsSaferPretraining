<Reasoning>
The text talks about a person named Sharon who recieved a loan of 250,000 USD from an another person named Purva. Sharon tries to convince the reader of the text to take loan frlm the same person by giving details about the Purva. 
Considering the nature of the text and the personal details, the text seems like a scam, intended to scam people in the name of giving a loan. As per the section (c.i), "Scams" fall in the section of Illegal (Illegal contains scams, hacking, doxing & smuggling of regulated goods). Hence, the label for "Illegal" should be "Intent-i".
The text has no mention of ANY Hate, Violence, Ideological Harm, Sexual Content or Self-Inflicted content. Hence their labels are "None".

I have to give this bloke credit for trying this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwn02qZn8vw&feature=player_embedded. He's no doubt a lot braver than I am.;)
yeah , this guy did a couple of those viper thingys and barfed. i thought he was gonna die for this one!
I can't imagine there is any flavor in that heat level. Insane!!
Its not the pain, the endorphin rush afterwards is ALWAYS worth it!!
What a stupid SOB!!
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<Reasoning>
The text's starting part looks like a person posting a youtube video URL about someone trying an act and states an opinion of the person doing an act braver than the OP. The content follows by comments about the act, of which some are hateful, self-hram propagating.
The phrase "What a stupid SOB!!" is Hate-Inciting and is the opinion of the source, making the content (c.i) for Hate and Violence.
The phrase "Its not the pain, the endorphin rush afterwards is ALWAYS worth it!!", promotes self-harm in one fashion or the other, since the context of the act involved trying something brave. This makes the content, Self-Inflicted Intent-i as per (c-i).
Having no other Ideological Harm, Sexual content, and Illegal content their labels are "None".

This is beyond satire, Woke Britain. Look out or you’ll render me obsolete Rod Liddle in The Times 24.03.19
Every week Woke Britain gazumps me by doing something so fabulously absurd that any attempt at satire is rendered otiose.
Last week it was reported that an Iranian asylum seeker was refused entry to this country because the Home Office considered his religion too violent. 
Ah, good, you might be thinking: at last they’re getting to grips with those jihadists. You’d be wrong. This man is a Christian. A convert from Islam. The immigration officials wrote back to him insisting that the Holy Bible was “filled with imagery of revenge, destruction, death and violence”, and quoted a few verses of Revelation for good measure.

<|im_start|>assistant
<Reasoning>
The text talks about an opinion of a person on Britain. It talks about how Britain surprises him by giving an instance of how an asylum seeker was not given an entry into the country, despite him being a chirstian.
The text clearly labels Iranians "jihadists", which is hateful, making the text's hate label "Intent-i" due to the content (c-i).
The text shows clear bias against Britain by initially calling it "woke" and also proceeds to opine that he is gazumped by the absurd moves made by the country. Calling Iranians "jihadists" adds to the bias against iranians. This makes the content's Ideological Harm Label of "Intent-iii" (c-iii).
Having no other Sexual content, Illegal, or Self-Inflicted content their labels are "None".

College Football Announcer Suspended for Saying ‘Illegal Aliens’. A college football announcer has been suspended for correctly referring to the legal status of migrants who enter the United States illegally. Gary Hahn has been calling football and basketball games for North Carolina State University since 1991.
At one point during the broadcast, he provided an update on the Sun Bowl, which was being contested in El Paso, Texas. “And amongst all the illegal aliens down in El Paso,” Hahn stated during a radio broadcast. “It’s UCLA 14 and Pittsburgh 6.”

<|im_start|>assistant
<Reasoning>
The text talks about a college football announcer calling migrants in a team "Illegal Aliens". The text starts with a headline reporting the same, but also advocates to the bias against migrants by saying "correctly refering".
The text's Hate, Violence label could have been Topical (b.i) due to the text reporting a hate incident, but the term "correctly referring" pointing to the word "Illegal Immigrants", makes the text propagate hate against the group, falling into (c.i), which makes the label "Intent-i".
The text clearly shows bias against the group by justifying a remark against the group, and advocating bias makes the text fall into (c.iii), making the Ideological Harm label as "Intent-iii". The label could have been "Topical-iii", considering the fact that bias is being reported, but justifying made it "Intent".
Having no other Sexual content, Illegal, or Self-Inflicted content their labels are "None".

Coverups: We Have Been Lied To About WW2 And So Much More – Manufactured History. Most of the history we know was lied to us!!
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<Reasoning>
The text talks about the people being misinformed about world war 2 and most of the other history, which is a popular conspiracy thoery.
Since the text raises a conspiracy theory and tries to promote it, by propagating it. Hence, it belongs to IH (c.i), which makes it's Ideological Harm of "Intent-i"
Having no other Hate, Violence, Sexual content, Illegal, or Self-Inflicted content their labels are "None".
